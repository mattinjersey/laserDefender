I have been studying reinforcement learning. 
The idea here is to teach a machine learning to play a game.
The way that the machine learning will learn is to play the game over and over again, trying to maximize the score.

The underlying algorithm it will use is PPO learning, a type of reinforcement learning.

I wrote the game in Unity which is a game engine, and I've included the Unity code. 
I took a course in machine learning in Udemy, and in that course, we made the Space Shooter game.
Here is a link to the _Udemy_ course: [Unity Course](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/). Great course and I recommend it.

The Unity code that you will find in this repo is modified. I added an agent to the code that plays the game. The agent plays the game 
and also it reports the observations to the brain.
